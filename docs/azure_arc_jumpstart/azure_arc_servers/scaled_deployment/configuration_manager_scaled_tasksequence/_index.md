## Connect an existing Windows server to Azure Arc using Configuration Manager with a Task sequence

The following README will guide you on how to connect a Windows machine to Azure Arc with a Task sequence using Configuration Manager.

This guide assumes that you already have an installation of [Microsoft Configuration Manager](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/configmgr/core/understand/introduction), at least one active Windows server client, an active distribution point and a basic understanding of the product.

## Prerequisites

- [Install or update Azure CLI to version 2.25.0 and above](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest). Use the below command to check your current installed version.

  ```shell
  az --version
  ```

- Enable subscription with the resource provider for Azure Arc-enabled Servers. Registration is an asynchronous process, and registration may take approximately 10 minutes.

  ```shell
  az provider register --namespace Microsoft.HybridCompute
  ```

  You can monitor the registration process with the following commands:

    ```shell
    az provider show -n Microsoft.HybridCompute -o table
    ```

- Create Azure service principal (SP)

    To connect a server to Azure Arc, an Azure service principal assigned with the "Contributor" role is required. To create it, login to your Azure account run the below command (this can also be done in [Azure Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com/)).

    ```shell
    az login
    az ad sp create-for-rbac -n "<Unique SP Name>" --role contributor
    ```

    For example:

    ```shell
    az ad sp create-for-rbac -n "http://AzureArcServers" --role contributor
    ```

    Output should look like this:

    ```json
    {
    "appId": "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
    "displayName": "AzureArcServers",
    "name": "http://AzureArcServers",
    "password": "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
    "tenant": "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
    }
    ```

    > **Note: The Jumpstart scenarios are designed with as much ease of use in-mind and adhering to security-related best practices whenever possible. It is optional but highly recommended to scope the service principal to a specific [Azure subscription and resource group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/ad/sp?view=azure-cli-latest) as well considering using a [less privileged service principal account](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/best-practices)**

- Create a new Azure resource group where you want your machine(s) to show up.

- Download the [_az_connect_win_](https://github.com/microsoft/azure_arc/blob/main/azure_arc_servers_jumpstart/scripts/az_connect_win.ps1) PowerShell script.

- Change the environment variables according to your environment and save the script.

## Creating an msi application for the Azure Connected Machine agent

- Download the Azure Connected Machine agent package for Windows from the [Microsoft Download Center](https://aka.ms/AzureConnectedMachineAgent) and copy it to the Configuration Manager server.

- Login to the Configuration Manager console.

- After logging in, go to the “Software Library” workspace. Under “Application Management”, Right-click  “Applications” and click "Create Application".
